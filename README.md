<h1> This repository show how is maked one system to supervise a tank with a certain liquid. look below at the whole system </h1>

## Who is level control ?
Level control comes from the beginnings of humanity, in Greece, the first control system of our humanity, by chance it was a level control of a water tank, using physical laws, which at the time were not so perceptible to knowledge. human, soon after all this, the father of systems control walter shewhart, a physicist and engineer, appeared, soon after that control only had to evolve, and reaching today in which we already have clear the main theorems and physical principles, Bernoulli's principle, Pascal's principle and others, from this also emerged mathematical systems, the PID, proportional integral and derivative systems.

## Softwares 

This Project uses any softwares:

- Supervisor Visu++: software used for control in control rooms.
- Vijeo Designer: Programming and screen creation system for field control and supervision of ihm's schneider.
- Machine Expert Basic: Software for programming and configuring Schneider PLCs.
- Node Red: System for control via the internet of things, whether with integration of tcp/ip protocols or mqtt connections.

## Supervisor Screen visualization visu++
  The first visualization system to be shown is the supervisory system, created with the visu++ software, this system is used for control rooms.

## Visualization Screen HMI
  We have already seen the supervisory system that is used in control rooms, but the control of a plant is not just controlled in the rooms, because of this we have human machine interfaces, in the plants, the HMI's, see below a screen of an HMI.

## Node Red Screen visualization

The node red system is mainly used nowadays for industry 4.0 integrations, making connections in large industrial networks, so that different data can be easily accessed from different locations, in addition this type of integration brings advantages in terms of speed and data visualization so that there is immediate or early intervention in the system if necessary.
